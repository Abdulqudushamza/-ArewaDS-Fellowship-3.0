# my Bio
- Abdulqudus Hamza
- I am a dedicated data science enthusiast with a background in statistics and a strong passion for solving real-world problems through data. Currently completing my SIWES internship and participating in the ArewaDS Followership, I’m building a versatile skill set, from data analysis to using tools like Anaconda, Visual Studio Code, WSL, and GitHub. Motivated by the belief that meaningful progress takes time, I’m committed to developing data-driven solutions and sharing my journey through writing. As I explore content creation on Medium, I aim to make data science accessible and engaging for a broader audience.
